# Outdated Tools

The tools in this folder are mostly outdated, the only one still relevant is `Vocab-to-Word.xsl` for producing newer revisions of [OData Vocabularies Version 4.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-vocabularies/v4.0/odata-vocabularies-v4.0.html), and even that most likely needs some tweaking before using it next time.

For refreshing the JSON vocabulary files and Markdown files from the XML vocabulary files use
```sh
npm run build
```
